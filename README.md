# Movie-Recommended-System
Recommender System is a system that seeks to predict or filter preferences according to the user's choices. A content based recommender works with data that the user provides, either explicitly (rating) or implicitly (clicking on a link). Based on that data, a user profile is generated, which is then used to make suggestions to the user.
